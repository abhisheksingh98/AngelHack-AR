# Anywhere Door AR

Our Project named Anywhere Door is Augmented Reality based Project in which the basic concept is travel before we go. <br>
We have an anywhere Door thorugh which we can go to places where we want to go without actually being there. <br>
In this we create a portal to an another place. The user just has to select the name of the place and that place will appear inside the portal.
We are implementing this idea using the power of ARCORE (Augmented Reality) and Unity Engine. <br>
This technology can provide the user to actually experience those locations which are inaccessible to an ordinary man. For eg. If an user want to experience another country. <br>
This project can be delivered using two ways :
- This project will deliver the user a 360 degree view of any place he wants to experience.
- Using any 3D Model of a place like Museum or any famous Hotel.
Our Inspiration for this Project --> Doraemon :D
